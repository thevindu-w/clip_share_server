        <h2>Client-Server Communication Protocol</h2>
        <p>
            The client and the server communicates through a TCP connection. The server listens on TCP port 4337 for
            unencrypted connections and 4338 for encrypted connections, which may be changed from the configuration. The
            client connects to the server and starts communicating. The client starts the communication by selecting the
            protocol version. To select the protocol version, the client negotiates with the server.
        </p>

        <h3 id="proto-negotiation">Protocol version negotiation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Client starts by sending the protocol version in a single byte (ex: if the protocol version is 1, the
                client sends
                \x01). The version numbers can range from 1 to 253. Client should always send the highest protocol
                version it supports.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the server supports that version, it accepts the protocol version and acknowledges the client by
                responding with the single byte of value \x01, which denotes protocol is supported. This will end the
                protocol version negotiation phase. The client can now continue communicating using the selected
                protocol version.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the server do not support that protocol version, and if the requested protocol version is less than
                the lowest version the server is supporting, the server informs this to the client by responding with
                the single byte of value \x02, which denotes protocol is obsolete and not supported. This will be the
                end of the communication as there can be no common protocol versions between the client and the server
                since the highest protocol version supported by the client is less than the lowest version supported by
                the server. Therefore, this ends both the negotiation phase and the entire communication. Now the client
                and the server will close the connection.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the server do not support that protocol version, and if the requested protocol version is higher than
                the highest version the server is supporting, the server informs this to the client by responding with
                the single byte of value \x03, which denotes protocol is unknown to the server and not supported. Then
                the server sends the highest protocol version it can support in a single byte to the client to offer the
                chance to use that protocol version if the client supports it. Negotiation continues if the client
                accepts the offered version
            </li>
            <li>
                If the client supports the protocol version offered by the server, it will acknowledge that to the
                server by sending the accepted protocol version back to the server in a single byte. This protocol
                version is now accepted by both the server and the client. This will end the protocol version
                negotiation phase. The client can now continue communicating using the selected protocol version.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the client do not support the offered protocol version, it rejects the offer by replying to the
                server with the single byte \x00. This implies that there are no common versions of the protocol between
                the server and the client. Therefore, this ends both the negotiation phase and the entire communication.
                Now the client and the server will close the connection.
            </li>
        </ul>
