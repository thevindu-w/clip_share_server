        <h1>Protocol Version 1</h1>

        <p>
            If the client and the server agree on protocol version 1 after <a
                href="index.html#proto-negotiation">negotiation</a>, the client starts communicating using that
            protocol. First, the client selects the method and requests it from the server. Then the server accepts the
            request, and they will continue the communication.
        </p>

        <h2 id="method-selection">Selecting the Method</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The client starts by sending the <a href="#method-codes">method code</a> in a single byte (ex: if the
                method code is 1, the client sends \x01). The method code can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 125. Refer to the <a
                    href="#supported-methods">Supported Methods</a> section for more information about the methods.
            </li>
            <li>
                Upon receiving the method request, the server responds with a single byte denoting the <a
                    href="#method-status-codes">method status code</a> for that request. If the method request is
                accepted, the server and the client will continue communication. Refer to the <a
                    href="#supported-methods">Supported Methods</a> section for more information about the structure of
                the remaining part of the communication.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the method request is not accepted or there is no more communication to happen, the client and the
                server will close the connection.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            When the server receives a method request from the client, it will respond to the client with one of the
            following status codes. The status code will be sent to the client as a single byte. For example, if the
            status code is 1, the server sends the byte \x01.

                        (possibly because there is no text or files copied into the clipboard of the server device).
                        Therefore, the communication ends at this point, and the connection can be closed now.

        <h2 id="supported-methods">Supported Methods</h2>
        <p>The following methods are supported in this protocol version.</p>
        <p id="encoding-notes">
            <b>Notes:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>All numeric values (ex: lengths, number of files) are sent/received as 64-bit signed integers in
                big-endian format.</li>
            <li>All the lengths of strings and file sizes are measured in bytes, and they are sent/received as
                numeric values as specified above.</li>
            <li>All the texts sent/received are UTF-8 encoded, and they do not contain a terminating null byte or any
                other prefixes or suffixes. The length of a text is calculated after encoding in this way.</li>
            <li>All the files sent/received are considered binary files. Therefore, the Unix/Windows style line endings
                or other platform-specific things in the file content are not changed. Also, the file content is
                considered a sequence of bytes, which is not modified (compressed or encoded) during transmission. The
                name of the files are considered as text and therefore sent/received as specified above.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-text">Get Text</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get the copied text from the server to the client. Once the client requests this
            method code from the server and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the server will send
            the length of the copied text followed by the copied text to the client. Once the copied text is
            transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed. The client may copy the received text
            to the clipboard of the client device.
        <ul>
            <li>The length is the number of bytes in the text sent after this. It should be less than 4 MiB in size. The
                length is encoded and sent as specified above in the note.</li>
            <li>The copied text is the text copied to the clipboard of the server device. It is encoded as specified
                above in the note.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="send-text">Send Text</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to send the copied text from the client to the server. Once the client requests this
            method code from the server and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the client will send
            the length of the copied text followed by the copied text to the server. Once the copied text is
            transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed. The server may copy the received text
            to the clipboard of the server device.
        <ul>
            <li>The length is the number of bytes in the text sent after this. It should be less than 4 MiB in size. The
                length is encoded and sent as specified above in the note.</li>
            <li>The copied text is the text copied to the clipboard of the client device. It is encoded as specified
                above in the note.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-files">Get Files</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get the copied files from the server to the client. This method only supports sending
            regular files (i.e., directories, links, or other types are not supported). Once the client requests this
            method code from the server and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the server will send
            the number of files to be sent. It is encoded as a numeric value as specified above in the note. After the
            number of files is sent, each file is sent sequentially as follows.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the length of the file name is sent. A file name can have at most 1024 bytes. It is encoded as
                specified above in the note.</li>
            <li>Then, the file name is sent. It is a text encoded as specified above in the note. The file name cannot
                contain the characters '/' (forward-slash) or '\' (back-slash).</li>
            <li>Followed by the file name, the size of the file is sent. File size can be at most 64 GiB. It is encoded
                as a numeric value specified above in the note.</li>
            <li>Then, the file content is sent. It is sent as a stream of bytes as specified above in the note.</li>
        </ul>
        Once all the files are transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed.
        </p>
        <h3 id="send-file">Send File</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to send a file from the client to the server. This method only supports sending a single
            regular file at a time (i.e., directories, links, or other types are not supported). Once the client
            requests
            this method code from the server and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the client will
            send the file to the server as follows.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the length of the file name is sent. A file name can have at most 1024 bytes. It is encoded as
                specified above in the note.</li>
            <li>Then, the file name is sent. It is a text encoded as specified above in the note. The file name cannot
                contain the characters '/' (forward-slash) or '\' (back-slash).</li>
            <li>Followed by the file name, the size of the file is sent. File size can be at most 64 GiB. It is encoded
                as a numeric value specified above in the note.</li>
            <li>Then, the file content is sent. It is sent as a stream of bytes as specified above in the note.</li>
        </ul>
        Once the file is transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed.
        </p>
        <h3 id="get-image">Get Image/Screenshot</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get a copied image or a screenshot from the server to the client. If the server
            device has an image copied to the clipboard, it will be sent. Otherwise, a screenshot of the server device
            will be sent as an image. The image is encoded as a PNG image. Once the client requests this method code
            from the server and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the server will send the image as
            follows.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the size of the image in bytes is sent. The image can be at most 1 GiB in size. It is encoded as
                a numeric value specified above in the note.</li>
            <li>Then, the image is sent. It is sent as a stream of bytes as specified above in the note.</li>
        </ul>
        Once the image is transmitted, the communication ends, and the connection can be closed. Note that there is no
        file name for the image. The client should create a file name if it needs to save this image as a file.
        </p>
        <h3 id="info">Info</h3>
        <p>
            This method is used to get the name of the server. Once the client requests this method code from the server
            and the server acknowledges the client with the status OK, the server will send the length of the name
            followed by the name "clip_share" to the client. Once the name is transmitted, the communication ends, and
            the connection can be closed.
        <ul>
            <li>The length is the number of bytes in the name sent after this. It is encoded and sent as
                specified above in the note.</li>
            <li>The name of the server is encoded as a text specified above in the note.</li>
